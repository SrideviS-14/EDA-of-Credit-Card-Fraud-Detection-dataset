# EDA-of-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis of Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset using Python
Inference from the analysis
The following are the inferences that I got from this analysis:
  ● The dataset is huge with a large number of rows and columns, hence handling it will be difficult and time consuming.
  ● There are no null values in the dataset
  ● All the values are unique and are not in a specific a range
  ● This dataset is highly imbalanced as the outcome column contains 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.
  ● Also the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
  ● The last column ‘Class’ is the output column that is the dependent variable while the others are the independent variables on which the final column is   
    dependent. These are the insightful inferences that I got after performing Exploratory Data Analysis on Credit card fraud detection - dataset.
